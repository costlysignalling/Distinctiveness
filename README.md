# Distinciveness or Asymmetry?
Code and data for the project on the influence of facial sextypicality, asymmetry, and distinciveness on attractiveness. Extended model contains also body height and BMI.

It is a good idea to start from **Distinctiveness.Rproj** file and than go consecutively from script **01.analysis.R** onwards.
The **data.clean.txt** file contains the data that were used to fit the models.

We are not authorized to share publicly the raw data of facial coordinates because of the recognizability of the target faces. The .tps datasets that are processed within the **00_data_arrange.R** script into the composite metrics in **data.clean.txt** can be obtained upon request with the authors at karel.kleisner@natur.cuni.cz or petr.turecek@natur.cuni.cz
